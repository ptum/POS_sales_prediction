# Point Of Sales features and sales prediction
The goal is to create a model that identifies important attributes in the surroundings that impact sales.

For performing this analysis,  following data sources are used:
•	‘sales_granular.csv’ - contains information about the sales volumes of a product at particular POS; each POS is uniquely identified by 'store_code'.
•	‘Surroundings.json’ - contains information about 90 different amenities (restaurants, shops, beauty salons etc.) that are in the surroundings of each POS.
